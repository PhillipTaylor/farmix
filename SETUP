This document details what's required to build and run Farmix.

PLATFORM SUPPORT
----------------

Farmix runs on 32 bit x86 machines. It currently does not work on any x86_64 environments.
Farmix will run inside QEMU and VirtualBox.

BUILD PREREQUISITS
------------------

Farmix is written on, and build on Linux systems. The following
tools are required:

	* make
	* gcc
	* nasm

COMPILING
---------

	Assuming you have installed the tools above, run `make` in
	the root directory for Farmix and it will build the entire
	system and output the file: ./build/farmix.bin

INSTALLING
----------

	Farmix requires a system with a multiboot compliant bootloader
	such as grub. In ./install there is a file named 41_Farmix
	which contains a sample grub entry. By opening your own grub
	configuration and inspecting your entry for Linux you should
	be able to figure out the correct values required to boot farmix.
